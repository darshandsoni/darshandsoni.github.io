    <p>This story can also be found on <a href="https://medium.com/@darshandsoni/natural-naming-for-software-repositories-4842903d7a6c#.1zs0qvw85">medium</a>.</p>

<p>A while back, I was invited to a fancy, upper-class lunch; all paid for. It’s a lunch I would not be able to afford with my wilted student wallet. A department head had some spare “discretionary funds” and decided to treat a bunch of vulture-like students to lunch, bless the good sir. It was indulgent and naturally, none of us knew what any of the food was because of all the hipster or haute nomenclature.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have been a better day as we learnt the names of edibles such as seabuckthorn, sunchoke, forcemeat and terrine. This was the start of a great new chapter! My colleagues and I had been discussing a plethora of ideas for GitHub repositories and there’s always something special about naming your repository. Having said that, I must admit that the random repo names GitHub suggests are often quite exquisite in their own way. Why just look at fictional-octo-couscous!</p>

<p>I settled on choosing the name <strong>seabuckthorn</strong> for a new repository. Had a nice ring to it. Simple enough to remember. Seabuckthorn would be the front-end to a curated mailing list that automatically pushes out a list of interesting articles to a select group of individuals — it’s chief purpose was to relieve me from the pain that occurs every time I find an interesting article and have to track down a particular person on their preferred social media platform to share it with them.</p>

<p>Alright so Seabuckthorn it was! But that’s what everyone could see and use. I needed a backend to this platform so what do we have to think of next? A backend repo name. Darn. Out of curiosity, I had the wikipedia page for Seabuckthorn open and I decided, heck why not <strong>“hippophae”</strong> — the official name for the family of sea-buckthorns. It seemed stunningly natural to name a backend repository after the Latin subfamily name for the very object that was my front-end. So we have seabuckthorn and it’s back-end hippophae. It then follows that any other variant of the platform could be a variation of the front-end name itself! An experimental version of the platform that allowed users to input content without my curation could be <strong>sandthorn</strong>. Akin to a sandbox but also an alternative name for the seabuckthorn. A variant for people who felt spammed and wanted to dial back emails to once a month could be <strong>sallowthorn</strong>. Again, another actual variant and a light-hearted prod at unhappy folk wishing me to email them less.</p>

<p>And as for the logo? A flat version of a seabuckthorn plant ought to do it! Who needs pricey graphic designers, project naming brainstorming meetings and pretentious logo roll-outs? Just use natural taxonomies!</p>
