			Hello. Bonjour. Jambo. My name is Darshan Soni and first up, thanks a tonne for visiting my site. I hope you found interesting content and a decent distraction from everyday chores.
			<br>
			I'm nationally Kenyan, ethnically Indian, residentially Canadian and proud of all three identities. I am currently pursuing a degree in Integrated Engineering, double-majoring in Civil (Transportation) Engineering and Materials engineering (apologies for the mouthful there).

			My professional interests involve urban planning with a strong focus in mass transit systems, public information design and information architecture.
