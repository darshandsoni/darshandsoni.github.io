I am an Integrated Engineer specialising in Civil and Materials Engineering with a focus on Transportation Systems.

Add to it a web developer, enthusiast of all things functional, self-taught polyglot (of both human and computer languages), Kenyan citizen and Canadian resident

But mainly, just a simple gentleman.

You can do the following here:

* Read through my articles.
* Read my <a target="_blank" href="/images/resume.pdf">resume</a> and C.V.
* Find links to the rest of my online presence.
* Support me by sharing.
* Contact me.

Note that contact requests with the offer of a beer, coffee or tea get expedited rather quickly!
