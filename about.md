			Hello. Bonjour. My name is Darshan Soni and first up, thanks a tonne for visiting my site. I hope you found interesting content and a decent distraction from everyday chores.
			<br><br>
			I am currently pursuing a degree in Integrated Engineering, double-majoring in Civil (Transportation) Engineering and Materials engineering (apologies for the mouthful there).
<br><br>
			My professional interests involve urban planning with a strong focus in mass transit systems, public information design and information architecture. I'm a hobbyist web developer, with 8 months of experience at the University of British Columbia. I lean towards robust, cloud-based, static sites with function dominating form.
