Group project as part of the UBC CIVL 430 course: Transportation Engineering 2. The project team worked with the City of Surrey Traffic Management Centre in Surrey, BC to evaluate the effectiveness of their pilot implementation of adaptive signalling; Surrey being one of the first municipalities in Canada to do so.

As part of the evaluation, traffic data from signal points was analysed and imported into a Synchro model. This was compared to alternative signal timing plans to determine the comparative advantages of implementing an adaptive signalisation system.

The final report is not yet publicly available but can be requested by email.
