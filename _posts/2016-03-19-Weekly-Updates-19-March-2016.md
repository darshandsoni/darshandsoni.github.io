# Weekly updates

## 12 March - 19 March 2016

Hello world! Apologies for yet again not following the week. I need to make this a better routine. Alright here we go:

### 1. Bad door
As we grieve about the new doors in the Nest, [here](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/26/11120236/bad-doors-human-centered-design) is a good video about door design. Don't you just hate door that look like they should be pulled but actually push? While I disagree with the author's "American design is right" stereotype, he has a point about good doors / design. Thanks to my colleague Ron Darvin for sharing this link.

### 2. Anon vs Trump
Oh [this](http://anonhq.com/anonymous-april-fools-surprise-donald-trump/) should be good! Anonymous have declared war on Trump. I hope it will be as entertaining as they make it seem!

### 3. The Hydraulic Press channel
This is a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcMDMoNu66_1Hwi5-MeiQgw) about a Finnish guy who owns a hydraulic press and uses it to crush phones, blenders, cameras... you name it. All bundled up with some deadpan commentary. What a beautiful channel. Cheers to my colleage Liam for sharing this.

### 4. Markdown - Stop word processing
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a brilliant tool for copiling documents quickly. The fact that you need not worry about formatting makes it so easy to learn and use. I already use it for compiling this message, taking notes and making documentation. My [website](http://darshandsoni.com) uses markdown inputs too, because why write in html? My website is still in development, but for fun, try out the 404 page ;) The IDE [Atom](https://atom.io/), which has mixed reviews and is far from perfect, is a decent IDE that is designed to be heavily expandable thanks to plugins. The markdown to themeable pdf plugin allows you to choose custom CSS styles. This means you can produce documents such as letterheads by simply calling your letterhead CSS stylesheet. It's a great tool to make document templates and zip out things like cover letters etc. Markdown does have it's shortfalls though. It is a very simplified markup and isn't the best for things like scientific papers or books.

### 5. Nylas N1
This new [email client](https://www.nylas.com/n1) (yes, yet another email client) was made by a neat company called Nylas. It was to do what Chrome did for the browser market - have plugins and add-ons. Written entirely in JavaScript, the developers want an open-source community to write whatever extensions they want for the email app. The sky is the limit.
However, to allow something like this to happen, they had to ditch ancient pop and IMAP and SMTP, instead creating their own API. By default, this API is on their server which means all your emails pass through their servers :( That said, it is open source and people can see what their code is doing on GitHub. If you're ultra-secure, they say you can instead set up the API locally and you need not use their servers. That does of course mean that your computer becomes a mail server. I tested this out on Fedora but it was so tedious: installing a vagrant box and setting it up in there that quite simply, I couldn't be fucked. Too bad. I really hope they change things there!

[These](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/linux_os_distribution_stickers/linux-debian-logo-mashup-edition-shaped-sticker) retro debian stickers look amazing.

That's all for this week. Don't want to make this too loaded!
Also, there is now quite a diverse community of recipients. If certain things don't interest you, just skip over them. If the entire mailing list doesn't seem to interest you, feel free to unsubscribe. I'd hate to be spamming you.

Cheers,
Darshan
